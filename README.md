## Description/What I attempted to do

Create an application that generates an .svg file based on user input. The final product is a log that includes a shape, shape color, text and text color selected by the user. The application is run by entering the comman "node index.js" into the terminal. I built this to easily generate simple logos on my own. As part of this project, I learned how to use classes as part of the code to generate an .svg logo. I also learned how to write and run tests on my code.
